# The Alchemist
### A Community Wiki for SteamOS

This wiki is a place where we can collect information about SteamOS, like tips and tricks and other useful information that gets buried in discussion threads. 

### Content

- [Complete list of pages](http://alchemistwiki.com/wiki)

### Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute here. You can either do it via this web interface by logging in via a Google account or by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/castrojo/vaporforge) directly.

The pages here are formatted in Markdown.

### Why not use Valve's Github Wiki?

Though SteamOS has [a wiki on github](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/wiki) it isn't very discoverable or being used, and contributing directly via github can be daunting for non-developers. So I thought I'd give it a shot aggregating things with a rememberable name using [Jingo](https://github.com/claudioc/jingo) so we can have nice things like a sidebar. 

There are commercial places that offer wiki services but I wanted something clean and ad-free. 

This site uses Github as the backend, so at some point in the future we can reconsolidate this if Valve wishes. In the meantime welcome and feel free to add content.
