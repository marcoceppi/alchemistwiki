# About Us
I'm just a guy that got sick of digging through thread after thread for useful information. After the 2nd time rebuilding my Steam Box I decided to start writing things down.

### Why not use Valve's Github Wiki?

Though SteamOS has [a wiki on github](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/wiki) it isn't very discoverable or being used, and contributing directly via github can be daunting for non-developers. So I thought I'd give it a shot aggregating things with a rememberable name using [Jingo](https://github.com/claudioc/jingo) so we can have nice things like a sidebar. 

There are commercial places that offer wiki services but I wanted something clean and ad-free. 

This site uses Github as the backend, so at some point in the future we can reconsolidate this if Valve wishes. In the meantime welcome and feel free to add content.
